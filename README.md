# Hax

Hax is a compiled programming language with a Perl-flavored surface syntax, designed for native compilation with explicit, predictable semantics.

This repository currently contains the language specification (grammar + semantics) and a few example programs.

## Repository layout

- `spec/` — language specification (grammar, lexer, semantics)
- `examples/` — small Hax examples
- `tools/` — tooling (reserved for compiler/parser tools)

## Status

Spec is evolving; see `spec/changelog.md`.
